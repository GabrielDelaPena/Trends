# t'Festival
This is a project made for the course Trends II. 
Our scope was the following: "An event needs to upgrade their website, they want to add 
payments method, make sure that a admin can log in and make changes. Also a client that has purchased a ticket needs to be able to see their ticket.
At the festival, security needs to be able to scan the code on the pdf, and also see if it is valid.
